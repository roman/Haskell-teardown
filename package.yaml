name: teardown
version: '0.3.0.0'
synopsis: Build composable components for your application with clear teardown semantics
description: |
  The teardown library allows you to reliably execute cleanup sub-routines for
  allocated resources when a program is initialized; it:

  * Ensures that teardown sub-routines are executed /exactly/ once, even on the
    scenario where cleanup is invoked multiple times

  * Ensures that if errors occur on the execution of one teardown, the error
    doesn not propagate to other sub-routines; effectively keeping them
    isolated.

  * Requires every teardown sub-routine to be documented at creation time; thus
    helping tracing your application structure.

  * Allows tracing the teardown of your application, how is structured, how much
    time it takes to execute, what component failed to finalize, and if the
    whole teardown was successful.

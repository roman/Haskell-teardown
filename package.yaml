name: teardown
version: '0.4.0.0'
synopsis: Build composable components for your application with clear teardown semantics
description: |
  The teardown library allows you to reliably execute cleanup sub-routines for
  allocated resources when a program is initialized; it:

  * Ensures that teardown sub-routines are executed /exactly/ once, even on the
    scenario where cleanup is invoked multiple times

  * Ensures that if errors occur on the execution of one teardown, the error
    does not propagate to other sub-routines; effectively keeping them isolated.

  * Requires every sub-routine to be documented at creation time; thus helping
    tracing your application structure.

  * Allows tracing the teardown of your application, how is structured, how much
    time it takes to execute, and what component (if any) failed to finalize.
